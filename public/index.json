In other words, pdca helps you plan, do, check and act.\nImprovement is a general concept and not limited to one type of improvement, workspace or outcome: as such, they can be improvements to things, processes, people, work relationships or indeed anything that improves the organization in some way.\nSome common examples:\nMoving things around in the workplace to increase the speed of production. Staff training leading to better knowledge and understanding of work activities. Changes to meeting frequencies or attendees to avoid time wasting or misunderstanding of priorities. Correcting errors in machine calibration or methods of calibration. Tidying a workspace area to promote efficiency.

If I cancel, what happens to the bills?\rSince payment is in advance, no further bills will be issued.\rIf I cancel, what happens to my access and data?\rIf you cancel, all account usage will be disabled with the exception that any admin user may login during the first 6 months after cancelling. Here they will have only two options: reactivate the account or permanently delete all system data. To permanently delete the data, notice of 7 days is required and all admins will be notified of this deletion in advance. This delay to avoid erroneous deletion of data. Regular users will not be allowed to login and will be directed to contact an admin user. All of your data will be kept for 6 months and then permanently deleted unless you manually delete it earlier than that. Data deletion is permenant so we recommend that your data is downloaded before account cancellation. Can I download my data?\rAny admin user can download a spreadsheet file containing all data in the system. Any user can download a grid of data using the in-page export buttons. Billing and Users When will I be billed?\rYou will be billed in advance and monthly starting on the same day you signed up so if you convert a trial account to a paid account on the 3rd of November, your first bill will be on the 3rd November and your second on the 3rd December.\rWhat will I be billed for?\rYou will be billed for the amount of active users on your account at the time of billing. Archived users do not count once their account has been archived continuously for 7 days. Deleted users do not count at all. The type of user (admin, manager, regular) does not make a difference to the total number of active users. What if I exceed the number of users in my plan temporarily during the month?\rThis won't necessarily increase your bill: you will be billed for the amount of active users on your account at the time of billing and so if you reduce the number by your billing date, you will not be charged for a higher plan. All admin users will get an email warning of the new billing level at the time your total number of users exceeds your plan maximum. The person creating the new user will also get an in application warning. What is the difference between a deleted user and an archived user?\rThere are two main differences: first, archived users still have their personal details (name, email address, mobile number etc) recorded in the system whereas deleted users have no details. In reports, \"Deleted User\" replaces the name of the user. Second, you can reactivate an archived user at any time whereas you cannot reactivate a deleted user and will have to create a new one.

A plan to implement that idea. A record that the planned improvement was implemented. A check on what happened during implementation. Any lessons learned and potentially a new improvement idea that follows on from the current one. Ideas for improvements can be big or small, theoretical or practical, expensive or cheap. They can be led by management or come from people on the shop floor.\nWithin this, pdca encapsulates the well known Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) cycle common to popular management practices such as Kaizen, ISO 9001 and many others. The PDCA method has been around in many forms for a long time: some people date it back to the invention of the scientific method. You can use PDCA even if you don\u0026rsquo;t follow a specific management methodology since most people agree that it is just a great way to continually improve your organization.\nYou can even create a Kanban board to help prioritise your improvements without overloading your work in progress. Finally pdca also inherently supports cyclical or continuous improvement.\npdca helps you understand the totality of your improvement programme: reporting allows you to see how many improvements are being worked on, where and at what stage.
