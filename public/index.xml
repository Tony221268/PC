      <description>In pdca, an improvement is a collection of activities that help you improve your organization in some way.
Usually, an improvement starts with a simple idea to make something better in the workplace but the &amp;ldquo;PDCA&amp;rdquo; cycle is inherent within the software. In other words, pdca helps you plan, do, check and act.
Improvement is a general concept and not limited to one type of improvement, workspace or outcome: as such, they can be improvements to things, processes, people, work relationships or indeed anything that improves the organization in some way.</description>

      <guid>/support/accountmanagement/billing/</guid>
      <description>How we calculate your bill. In pdca software, billing is by tier.
On your monthly billing date (at midday GMT), we calculate the amount of users* you have. We then cross check that number with our 3 pricing tiers. We&amp;rsquo;ll then send you an appropriate bill in your chosen currency for the next month.
You will therefore be billed in advance and monthly starting on the same day you signed up so if you convert a trial account to a paid account on the 3rd of November, your first bill will be on the 3rd November and your second on the 3rd December.</description>
