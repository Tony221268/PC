      <description>Trials and Active accounts Trial and active accounts are the same except that an active account is paid for. Follow the instructions below to activate your trial.
A trial account typically lasts for 30 days. At that point it will become dormant and you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to use it. If you are an admin user and you login to a dormant account then you will be offered the opportunity to reactivate the account.</description>
