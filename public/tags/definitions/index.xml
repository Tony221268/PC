      <description>In pdca, an improvement consists of a logical series of steps or a &amp;ldquo;cycle&amp;rdquo; aimed at improving something in your organization:
An idea or suggestion for an improvement. A plan to implement that idea. A record that the planned improvement was implemented. A check on what happened during implementation. Any lessons learned and potentially a new improvement idea that follows on from the current one. Ideas for improvements can be big or small, theoretical or practical, expensive or cheap.</description>
